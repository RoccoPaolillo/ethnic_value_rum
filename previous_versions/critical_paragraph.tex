% Narrow down, Schelling popularity and empirical support

\autocite{clark2008understanding}, for example, characterize the empirically measured neighborhood preferences of different racial groups in a large-scale U.S. survey study such that "none of groups has a preference distribution that is compatible with that of any other group" (p. 4111) under the dynamics of a Schelling-type model. Their theoretical modelling work, incorporating empirically informed assumptions about ethnic preferences, evokes the impression that sharp ethnic residential segregation is almost inevitable in multi-ethnic cities as long as preference dynamics have a significant role to play in residential choices (Other fittings refs here?).
